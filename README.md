# IP and TCP from Scratch

A C implementation of the IP and TCP protocols built from the ground up.  
This project is intended purely for educational purposes, focusing on understanding
how these protocols work internally.  
No optimizations were made for performanceâ€”efficiency was not a goal.

[X] IP
[ ] TCP
